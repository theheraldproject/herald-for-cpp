/**
 * /brief Uses the Analysis API in Herald to observe sensor readings and turn them into
 * aggregated exposure scores.
 *
 * This class also responds to external modifications to exposure confidence. E.g.
 * turning a general proximity exposure score into a "confirmed" COVID-19 exposure score.
 *
 * As an example, as I walk about I may have 0.9 (near full confidence) in a proximity score
 * but I do not convert that to a COVID-19 exposure until someone becomes symptomatic or is tested.
 * Should this occur, I could use the exposure scores from proximity to generate COVID-19 exposure
 * by aggregating sets of scores from different people with different levels of confidence.
 * If someone is symptomatic I may set COVID-19 (NOT raw proximity) confidence to 0.2, when they
 * have a positive lateral flow test perhaps 0.67 (approx the true positive rate of LFTs) and when a PCR
 * test is positive, to 0.98. This class manages the complex exposure scoring behind this.
 * 
 * This allows the related Risk Score algorithms to deal with all exposures in the same manner - 
 * that is, summary scores of exposure to 'Agents' over specific periods of time.
